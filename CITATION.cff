abstract: >
  RAE (Reflective Agentic-Memory Engine) is an open-source cognitive architecture designed to provide Long-Term Memory (LTM) for AI Agents. It implements a neurological-inspired tiered memory system (Episodic, Working, Semantic, Reflective) and supports decentralized synchronization via the RAE Mesh protocol.
