## Description
This PR fixes a critical issue where tests were failing with `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'start_as_current_span'` because `get_tracer` returned `None` when OpenTelemetry was unavailable/disabled in the test environment.

## Changes
- Modified `apps/memory_api/observability/opentelemetry_config.py` to return a `NoOpTracer` instead of `None`.
- Added `NoOpTracer` and `NoOpSpan` classes to handle tracing calls gracefully.
- Ran `make format` to ensure code style compliance.
- Verified with full test suite (786 passed).

## Testing
- [x] `pytest` passes locally.
- [x] `make lint` passes.
- [x] `make security-scan` passes.
