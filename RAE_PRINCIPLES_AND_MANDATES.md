# RAE: Principles and Mandates

## 1. Core Philosophy
- **Agnosticism First**: `rae-core` must be 100% independent of specific storage, cache, or database implementations. No hard imports of `asyncpg`, `qdrant`, or `redis` inside core.
- **RAE-First Architecture**: Memory is a mandatory side effect of action. Agents cannot bypass RAE for IO or memory.
- **Privacy-First & Local-First**: The system must be fully functional offline (Ollama + SQLite/Local Vector). User data belongs to the user.
- **OpenSource-First**: Architecture must be transparent and modular.
- **Rust-Ready**: Core logic must be pure, typed, and highly tested to facilitate future migration to Rust.

## 2. Structural Integrity
- **Project Isolation**: Data from Project A must NEVER leak into Project B. Context building must enforce strict scoping.
- **Multi-Agent & Multi-Human**: The memory core must handle concurrent input from various LLMs and human operators, enforcing the same consistency rules for everyone.
- **RAE-Lite (Math Mode)**: Must provide value through importance decay, similarity clustering, and frequency analysis even when no LLM is available.

## 3. Implementation Rules
- **No Thoughtless Coding**: Always check for existing functionality before adding new code.
- **No Functional Duplicates**: If a logic exists in Core, it must not be replicated in the API or Adapters.
- **Data Integrity**: Every defined table must have a clear purpose and an active writer. "Ghost tables" are not allowed.
- **Hybrid Intelligence**: Reflections can be generated by various models (Ollama, DeepSeek, etc.) across a compute cluster, but must be stored in a unified format.
