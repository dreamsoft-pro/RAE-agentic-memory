Integration tests for GraphRAG functionality.

These tests verify the complete GraphRAG pipeline:
- Graph extraction from episodic memories
- Knowledge graph storage
- Hybrid search with graph traversal
- Context synthesis

Prerequisites:
- Running PostgreSQL instance
- Running Qdrant/pgvector instance
- Configured LLM provider (OpenAI, Anthropic, or Gemini)
