## 🚀 Getting Started

### Development Setup

1. **Fork and clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/RAE-agentic-memory.git
cd RAE-agentic-memory
```

2. **Set up your development environment:**

```bash
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
make install

# Or install all dependencies (including integrations)
make install-all
```

3. **Start the infrastructure:**

```bash
# Start Docker services
docker-compose up -d

# Or use make
make start
```

4. **Run tests to verify setup:**

```bash
make test
```

### Making Changes

1. **Create a new branch:**

```bash
git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature
# or
git checkout -b fix/bug-description
```

2. **Make your changes:**
   - Write clear, commented code
   - Follow our code style (see below)
   - Add tests for new functionality
   - Update documentation as needed

3. **Test your changes:**

```bash
# Run all tests
make test

# Run specific tests
pytest apps/memory_api/tests/test_specific.py

# Run with coverage
make test-cov
```

4. **Format and lint:**

```bash
# Auto-format code
make format

# Run linters
make lint

# Or let pre-commit handle it
pre-commit run --all-files
```

5. **Commit your changes:**

We use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

```bash
git commit -m "feat: add amazing feature"
git commit -m "fix: resolve authentication bug"
git commit -m "docs: update API documentation"
git commit -m "test: add tests for hybrid search"
git commit -m "refactor: simplify graph traversal"
git commit -m "chore: update dependencies"
```

**Commit message format:**
- `feat:` - New feature
- `fix:` - Bug fix
- `docs:` - Documentation only
- `test:` - Adding tests
- `refactor:` - Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `perf:` - Performance improvement
- `chore:` - Maintenance tasks

6. **Push and create a Pull Request:**

```bash
git push origin feature/amazing-feature
```

Then open a PR on GitHub.

## 📋 Pull Request Process

1. **Ensure your PR:**
   - Has a clear title describing the change
   - References related issues (use `Fixes #123` or `Closes #456`)
   - Includes tests for new functionality
   - Updates documentation if needed
   - Passes all CI checks

2. **PR Review:**
   - A maintainer will review your PR
   - Address any requested changes
   - Once approved, a maintainer will merge it

3. **After merging:**
   - Your contribution will be included in the next release
   - You'll be added to the CONTRIBUTORS list
   - Thank you! 🎉

## 💻 Code Style

We use automated formatters and linters to maintain code quality:

### Python Style

- **Black** for code formatting (100 char line length)
- **isort** for import sorting
- **ruff** for linting
- **mypy** for type checking (optional but recommended)

**Run formatters:**
```bash
make format  # Auto-formats all code
```

**Run linters:**
```bash
make lint  # Checks code style
```

### Code Guidelines

- Use type hints where possible
- Write docstrings for public functions/classes
- Keep functions focused and small
- Write self-documenting code (clear variable names)
- Add comments for complex logic only
- Follow PEP 8 style guide

**Example:**

```python
async def store_memory(
    self,
    content: str,
    layer: MemoryLayer,
    tags: list[str] | None = None,
    metadata: dict[str, Any] | None = None
) -> MemoryRecord:
    """
    Store a memory in the specified layer.

    Args:
        content: The memory content to store
        layer: Memory layer (episodic, working, semantic, ltm)
        tags: Optional tags for categorization
        metadata: Optional additional metadata

    Returns:
        The stored memory record

    Raises:
        ValidationError: If content is empty or invalid
        StorageError: If storage fails
    """
    if not content.strip():
        raise ValidationError("Content cannot be empty")

    # ... implementation
```

## 🧪 Testing Guidelines

- **Write tests for all new features**
- **Maintain >= 75% code coverage overall, 80%+ for core modules**
- **Use pytest fixtures for common setup**
- **Mark tests appropriately** (`@pytest.mark.unit`, `@pytest.mark.integration`)

**Current Testing Status:**
- See [docs/TESTING_STATUS.md](docs/TESTING_STATUS.md) for current test coverage and status
- Target: 75%+ overall coverage, 80%+ for core modules (services, repositories)
- Current: 32.25% overall (200/264 tests passing)

**Test structure:**

```python
import pytest
from apps.memory_api.services import MemoryService

@pytest.fixture
async def memory_service():
    """Fixture for memory service with mocked dependencies."""
    service = MemoryService(...)
    yield service
    await service.cleanup()

@pytest.mark.unit
async def test_store_memory_success(memory_service):
    """Test successful memory storage."""
    result = await memory_service.store_memory(
        content="Test memory",
        layer="episodic"
    )

    assert result.id is not None
    assert result.content == "Test memory"
    assert result.layer == "episodic"

@pytest.mark.integration
async def test_query_memory_integration(memory_service, db_connection):
    """Test memory query against real database."""
    # Requires services to be running
    ...
```
