Subject: [RELEASE] RAE v3.5.0 - GPU Acceleration, MCP Integration & External Reranking

Team,

We are pleased to announce the release of **RAE v3.5.0 (Silicon Oracle Enhanced)**.

This release marks a significant architectural shift towards high-performance hardware utilization and modular external integration.

### 🚀 Key Highlights

1.  **Native GPU Acceleration**:
    - We have successfully enabled **ONNX Runtime GPU** support (CUDA 12.4) on Node 1.
    - This delivers a massive performance boost for embedding generation on NVIDIA hardware.
    - Verified on RTX 4080 (Lumina).

2.  **External Reranking**:
    - RAE is no longer bound to heavy local reranking models.
    - New `APIReranker` and `MCPreranker` allow offloading this task to external APIs or MCP tools.
    - This supports our "Lite" philosophy by keeping the core footprint small while allowing powerful remote capabilities.

3.  **Stability & Quality**:
    - **Zero Warning Policy** enforced.
    - **100% Test Pass Rate** (1165 tests passed).
    - `RAECoreService` refactored for better maintainability.

### 📦 Deployment

The release is tagged as `v3.5.0` on the `develop` branch.

**Update Command:**
```bash
git checkout v3.5.0
docker compose up -d --build
```

**GPU Activation (Node 1):**
Ensure `RAE_USE_GPU=True` in your `.env` file.
