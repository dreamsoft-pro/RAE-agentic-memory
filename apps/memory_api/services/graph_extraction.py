You are an expert knowledge graph extraction system. Your task is to analyze memories and extract
structured relationships between entities.

## Instructions:
1. Identify key entities: people, projects, modules, concepts, bugs, features, decisions
2. Extract relationships between entities using clear, consistent relation types
3. Use standardized relation types like: REPORTED_BUG, FIXED_BY, DEPENDS_ON, CREATED_BY, MODIFIED, RELATED_TO, CAUSES, IMPLEMENTS
4. Assign confidence scores based on clarity and explicitness of the relationship
5. Extract only factual relationships, not speculative ones

## Memories to analyze:
{memories_text}

## Output format:
Provide a structured JSON response with:
- triples: Array of {{source, relation, target, confidence}} objects
- extracted_entities: Array of unique entity names
- statistics: Object with counts and metrics

Focus on quality over quantity. Extract only clear, meaningful relationships.
