"""
Integration tests for GraphExtractionService using Testcontainers.

These tests verify the refactored Repository/DAO pattern implementation:
- GraphExtractionService uses RAECoreService for memory access
- GraphExtractionService uses GraphRepository for graph operations
- Proper JSONB serialization/deserialization
- Complete triple storage workflow (nodes + edges)

Prerequisites:
- Docker running (for testcontainers)
- testcontainers Python package installed
