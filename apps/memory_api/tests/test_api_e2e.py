"""
E2E API Smoke Tests

End-to-end smoke tests to verify the API works on fresh installation.
These tests validate the complete request flow through the system.

Test Coverage Goals (per test_2.md):
- Happy path: POST /memories → GET /search works
- Happy path: Memory storage → Hybrid search retrieval
- Critical for: "Install, run, it works" verification

Priority: HIGH (Shows project is production-ready)
Type: Integration/E2E tests

NOTE: These E2E tests require full infrastructure (API + DB + Vector Store)
and are currently skipped pending full integration testing setup.
For unit/integration tests with real DB, see test_hybrid_search.py which uses testcontainers.
