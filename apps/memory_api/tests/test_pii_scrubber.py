Tests for PII Scrubber

Enterprise-grade test suite for PII detection and anonymization.
Critical for security and compliance (GDPR, HIPAA, etc.).

Test Coverage Goals (per test_2.md):
- Email addresses → masked
- API keys/tokens → masked
- IP addresses / credit cards → masked
- Plain text → unchanged

Priority: HIGH (Critical for security before OSS release)
Current Coverage: 0% -> Target: 70%+
