# ML requirements for RAE Memory API (Heavy - Optional)
# Only needed if running embeddings/reranking/graph analysis locally instead of using external services
# Total size: ~3-4GB

# WARNING: These dependencies make Docker image very large
# Consider using dedicated microservice (reranker-service) or external API instead

# Machine Learning & Entity Resolution
scikit-learn

# Graph Analysis & Community Detection
networkx
python-louvain

# PII Detection (Local)
presidio-analyzer
presidio-anonymizer

# Runtime Optimization
onnxruntime

# Note: If you need these features, consider:
# 1. Using external API services (OpenAI embeddings, HuggingFace API)
# 2. Running dedicated microservice for ML workloads (apps/reranker-service)
# 3. Using serverless functions for occasional ML tasks
