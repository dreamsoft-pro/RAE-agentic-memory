# RAE Session Summary - 2026-01-15

## Goal
Stabilize RAE-Core, Fix Lite Profile regressions, and establish a mandatory session startup protocol.

## Achievements

### 1. Documentation & Protocol
- **Created `DEVELOPER_CHEAT_SHEET.md`**: Centralized hub for critical commands, benchmark maps, and MCP info.
- **Updated `GEMINI.md`**: Added mandatory startup protocol (Read Cheat Sheet -> Verify Cluster).
- **Created `TEST_INVENTORY.txt`**: Complete list of discoverable tests for easier debugging.

### 2. Codebase Stabilization (Green State)
- **RAE-Core Coverage (99%)**: 
    - Fixed infinite recursion in `test_strategies_coverage.py`.
    - Added `test_final_coverage.py` to cover edge cases.
    - All 364 core tests passed.
- **Lite Profile Fixes**:
    - Implemented automatic "Math-only" mode switch in `rae_core_service.py`. This prevents 500 errors when Vector/Ollama services are missing.
    - Fixed `docker-compose.test-sandbox.yml` port mapping (8010:8000) and missing env vars.
- **Database & Governance Fixes**:
    - Resolved `DataError` in `postgres.py` and `rbac_service.py` by forcing `str(tenant_id)` for `asyncpg` compatibility.
    - Refactored `tests/api/v1/test_governance.py` to use valid UUIDs, fixing 422 errors.

### 3. Verification
- **Unit Tests**: `make test-core` -> **PASSED** (364 tests).
- **Integration Tests**: `make test-int` -> **PASSED** (53 tests).
- **Infrastructure**: MCP Hotreload (Port 8001) confirmed healthy via `curl`.

## Next Steps
- **Dashboard**: Focus on fixing and improving the RAE Dashboard in the next session.
- **Benchmarks**: Execute the full benchmark suite (Academic Lite/Extended) to verify performance metrics.


## Hard Frames v3.0 Validation (2026-01-20)
- Verified on Lumina cluster (Node 1).
- Secure Agent isolated successfully (No Internet, Kernel-only access).
- UID enforcement confirmed (running as non-root user 999).
- Zero socket leakage detected during 100k stress tests.


## Soak Test Launch (2026-01-20)
- Status: COMPLETED (Success).
- Duration: ~1 hour (3600+ requests).
- Stability: RAM flat at ~31MB. No leaks.
- Isolation: Google access blocked consistently.

## Hard Frames v3.0 Final Report (2026-01-20)
### 1. "The Prisoner Test" (Real Integration)
- **Objective**: Verify if a Hard-Framed Agent can communicate with REAL RAE API while blocked from the internet.
- **Result**: PASSED.
- **Mechanism**: Implemented `SecureSocket` class (inheriting from `socket.socket`) to support SSL/TLS correctly.
- **Outcome**: Agent successfully hit `rae-api-dev` (Health 200 OK) but was blocked from Google (RuntimeError).

### 2. "Industrial Ingestion Benchmark" (100k Memories)
- **Scope**: Verified full end-to-end data ingestion (Agent -> API -> DB/Vector) under Hard Frames protection.
- **Scale**: 100,000 realistic Industrial IoT logs sent via HTTP.
- **Duration**: ~59 minutes (3530s).
- **Throughput**: **28.34 memories/second** (Consistent).
- **Errors**: 0 (100% Success).
- **Conclusion**: RAE system is stable for massive ingestion campaigns while fully isolated from the public internet.

### 4. Search Quality Audit (Recall Check)
- **Status**: **POOR PRECISION** (Needs Improvement).
- **Finding**: While data is successfully ingested, retrieval via pure vector search struggles to distinguish between similar machine logs (e.g., confusing 'PRESS-A' with 'ROBOT-ARM-Z').
- **Scores**: Low similarity scores (~0.006) indicate the embedding model needs fine-tuning for structured log data.
- **Recommendation**: Implement **Sparse Vectors (BM25)** or strict Metadata Filtering for future industrial deployments to ensure exact matches for machine IDs.

### 5. Infrastructure Optimizations
- Added `.dockerignore` to root, reducing build context from 1.7GB to <10MB.
- Tests running on Lumina (Node 1) are now fast and stable.
