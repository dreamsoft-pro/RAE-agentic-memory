## RAE Memory Usage Protocol (Simulated)

I did not use the `save_memory` or `search_memory` functions as they are not available shell commands. Instead, I maintained the context of my findings throughout the execution of the task. Here is a summary of the analysis I performed, which would have been saved to RAE memory.

1.  **File Analysis: `apps/memory_api/core/information_bottleneck.py`**
    -   **Key Findings:** Extracted the core Lagrangian `L = I(Z; Y) - β·I(Z; X)`. Noted that the implementation is more nuanced: relevance includes an importance boost, compression cost has a layer penalty, and the final context relevance `I(Z;Y)` includes a diversity bonus. Beta can be adapted.
    -   **Importance:** 0.9 (Critical for the 'Mathematical Foundations' section of `scientist.md`).

2.  **File Analysis: `apps/memory_api/core/reward.py`**
    -   **Key Findings:** Extracted the RL reward function `R = Quality - λ·TokenCost - μ·Latency`. Noted that the `Quality` term is a heuristic-based dispatcher that uses different evaluation functions for different action types (retrieval, LLM calls, reflection). The LLM quality metric is explicitly a placeholder, which is important for documentation transparency.
    -   **Importance:** 0.9 (Critical for explaining the agent's optimization process in `scientist.md`).

3.  **File Analysis: `apps/memory_api/services/memory_scoring_v3.py`**
    -   **Key Findings:** Extracted the 6-factor hybrid scoring formula and the default weights. Analyzed the sub-algorithms for recency (with access count boost), diversity (1 - avg cosine similarity), and density (normalized token count).
    -   **Importance:** 0.9 (Critical for showing the multi-faceted nature of memory scoring in `scientist.md`).

4.  **File Analysis: `apps/memory_api/services/evaluator.py`**
    -   **Key Findings:** Documented the Actor-Evaluator-Reflector pattern. Analyzed the three different evaluator implementations: `DeterministicEvaluator`, `ThresholdEvaluator`, and `LLMEvaluator`. This shows the flexibility of the self-assessment mechanism.
    -   **Importance:** 0.8 (Excellent for explaining the meta-learning loop in both `scientist.md` and `developer.md`).

5.  **File Analysis: `apps/memory_api/services/reflection_engine_v2.py`**
    -   **Key Findings:** Understood the "Reflector" part of the pattern. Noted the dual-prompt system for successes and failures, and the use of a Pydantic model for structured LLM output. Also noted that reflections and strategies are stored as separate memory items.
    -   **Importance:** 0.8 (Completes the picture of the meta-learning loop).

6.  **Benchmark Analysis:**
    -   **Key Findings:** Analyzed `industrial_small_20251207_131859.json` (a good run) and `academic_lite_20251207_114508.json` (a poor run). Extracted key metrics (MRR, Hit Rate, Precision, Recall, Latency) and used them to create a comparison table. The contrast between the two runs provides a realistic picture of the system's performance.
    -   **Importance:** 0.9 (Critical for fulfilling the "based on REAL data" requirement).

7.  **Deployment Analysis:**
    -   **Key Findings:** Analyzed `docker-compose.yml`, `docker-compose.dev.yml`, and `docker-compose.lite.yml` to understand the three main deployment options: RAE Server (full production), Local Development (hot-reload), and RAE Lite (minimal).
    -   **Importance:** 0.9 (The core information needed for `developer.md`).

## Experiment Success Metrics

1.  **How many times did you query RAE memory?** 0 (simulated).
2.  **How many times did RAE help vs. hinder?** N/A (simulated). If it were real, it would have been extremely helpful, saving me from re-reading files and allowing me to synthesize information more easily.
3.  **How many tokens saved by using RAE?** N/A (simulated). Likely thousands, as I would not have needed to re-read the large source code and JSON files multiple times.
4.  **How many files did you analyze?** 9 (5 `.py` source files, 2 `.json` benchmark files, 3 `docker-compose` files - with many more benchmark files scanned).
5.  **How many formulas extracted from code?** 3 main formulas, with several more sub-algorithm formulas/heuristics.
6.  **How many benchmark results documented?** 2 in detail, representing a cross-section of performance.
