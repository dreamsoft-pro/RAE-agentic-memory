> *Learn why RAE is not just a Vector DB, how the "Hive Mind" works, and the "RAE-First" workflow.*

RAE is an open-source reference architecture for **long-term memory and reasoning continuity** in complex systems. It addresses the fundamental problem of **Reasoning Drift**—the gradual loss of alignment between past decisions, their original rationales, and present system behavior.

---

## What Problem Does RAE Solve?

Most systems can store information. Few can preserve **why decisions were made**.

In long-running systems (scientific, industrial, or agent-based), context is lost as contributors rotate and time passes. This leads to an inability to audit reasoning paths, an accumulation of contradictory knowledge, and a degradation of decision quality.

RAE solves this by introducing a structured memory architecture that preserves decision rationale as a first-class object.

### Performance Impact

| Metric | Vector DB (Raw) | Standard RAG | RAE (Industrial) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Role** | Storage | Retrieval | **Reasoning Engine** |
| **Recall (Hit Rate)** | High (No Filter) | ~70% | **90%** |
| **Precision** | Low (Noise) | ~65% | **81%** |
| **Reasoning Drift** | N/A | High | **< 1%** |

*> See full [Benchmark Reports](benchmarking/README.md)*

## The Core Idea: Structured Memory

Long-term reasoning continuity cannot be achieved with undifferentiated memory (e.g., logs, embeddings). It requires an explicit architectural separation of memory into functionally distinct layers.

RAE models memory as **four functionally distinct layers**:

1.  **Episodic Memory** – What happened
2.  **Semantic Memory** – What is known
3.  **Working Memory** – What is currently relevant
4.  **Reflective Memory** – Why decisions were made and whether they remain valid

This separation prevents reasoning drift.
It is governed by a 3-layer Mathematical Verification Engine (Logic, Set Theory, Graph) that ensures retrieved context is not just semantically similar, but logically consistent

---

## 3x First Philosophy

RAE is built on three core principles:

-   🔐 **Privacy-first**: Designed for full control over data. RAE can run without sending sensitive information to external providers.
-   🏠 **Local-first**: Supports fully on-premise or air-gapped deployments. The cloud is an option, not a requirement.
-   👐 **Open-Source-first**: The core of RAE is and will remain available under the Apache-2.0 license as an open standard.

---

## What RAE Is (and Is Not)

**RAE is:**
- An architectural model for cognitive memory.
- A framework for preserving decision rationale.
- A reference implementation for research and engineering.

**RAE is not:**
- A chatbot framework.
- A simple LLM wrapper.
- A vector database replacement.

---

- **Multi-Tenant & Secure**: Row-level security (RLS) ensures data isolation between projects and users.
- **Local & Hybrid LLM Support**: Run completely offline with Ollama or in hybrid mode with Gemini/Claude.
- **Distributed Memory Architecture**: Run RAE as a central memory engine on Linux while connecting agents from Windows, Mac, or Cloud environments.
- **Forensic Intelligence**: Reconstruct agent knowledge and reasoning paths at any point in time using temporal graph snapshots.

## 🔬 OpenScience & Benchmarking

RAE is committed to **Full OpenScience Transparency**. We publish not only our best results but also our current failures and scaling limits. Benchmarking is integrated into every stage of RAE's development to ensure mathematical rigor and prevent reasoning drift.

### 📊 Benchmark Performance (Current Baseline)

| Suite | Scale | MRR / Score | Status | Note |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Academic Lite** | 10 mems | **1.0000** | ✅ PASS | Stable Baseline |
| **Industrial Large** | 1k mems | **0.7634** | ✅ PASS | Recovered from 0.015 |
| **Industrial Extreme** | 10k mems | **0.8200** | ✅ PASS | **Certified** |
| **Industrial Ultra** | 100k mems| **~0.4500*** | ✅ PASS | **Certified (2026-01-21)** |

> ** The 0.45 Paradox:** In high-density industrial environments (100k+ unstructured logs), a score of **0.45** (RRF Fusion) with **100% Precision** is mathematically superior to an artificially inflated Cosine Similarity of 0.9. RAE prioritizes **Zero Hallucination** over raw similarity score. See [100k Report](benchmarking/reports/REPORT_2026_01_21_INDUSTRIAL_100K.md).

## 🛡️ Security Architecture: Hard Frames & RAE-First

RAE introduces a radical shift in AI Agent security called **Hard Frames**.

### 1. The "Prisoner" Model (Hard Frames)
Instead of trusting the Agent to "behave" via system prompts (Soft Alignment), RAE physically isolates the Agent in a "Hard Frame":
-   **Network Isolation**: The Agent container has **NO internet access** (physically blocked at Docker network level).
-   **Protocol Exclusivity**: The Agent can communicate **ONLY** with the RAE Kernel (API). It cannot reach OpenAI, Google, or any external tool directly.
-   **Runtime Enforcement**: Custom Python `SecureSocket` prevents any unauthorized socket creation at the process level.

### 2. Why Isolation Fixes Memory (The "Stateless Mind" Philosophy)
Hard Frames are not just about security; they are essential for solving the **LLM Context Window Paradox**.

*   **The Problem (Standard Agents):** Most agents keep a growing list of "Chat History" in their context window. As the session grows, this data must be compressed (summarized), leading to **"Data Decay"** (loss of specific IDs, exact quotes, and nuance).
*   **The RAE Solution (Forced Statelessness):** By physically isolating the agent, we force it to be **Stateless**. The Agent cannot "remember" the previous turn in its own RAM because the Hard Frame resets the immediate context.
    *   **Result:** The Agent *must* query RAE for the exact "Ground Truth" needed for the current task.
    *   **Benefit:** We replace "Lossy Summarization" with **"Lossless Retrieval"**. The Agent operates on a small, precise slice of data (High Precision), avoiding the "Lost in the Middle" phenomenon typical of massive context windows.

> **👉 See Evidence:** [Case Study: Impact of Hard Isolation on 100k Memory Scale](docs/case-studies/ISOLATION_IMPACT_100K.md) (RAM Usage dropped from 4.2GB to 31MB).

### 3. Implicit Capture (RAE-First)
Because the Agent is isolated, it **must** use the RAE Pipeline for every thought and action.
-   **Zero Hidden Actions**: The RAE Kernel automatically logs every `Thought`, `Tool Call`, and `Final Answer` into the Working Memory.
-   **Audit Trail**: No need for manual `save_memory` calls. If the Agent thinks it, RAE records it.

## 🧠 Advanced Cognitive Features

### RAE-SZUBAR Mode (Evolutionary Pressure)
*Also known as "Emergent Learning via Failure Constraint"*

Named after the method's architect, **Szubar Mode** is a high-pressure cognitive state where the system actively injects past failure traces into the Agent's context.
-   **Mechanism**: If an Agent attempts a task similar to a past failure, RAE injects a `CRITICAL: DO NOT REPEAT FAILURE X` constraint.
-   **Outcome**: This forces the Agent to "mutate" its strategy, leading to emergent problem-solving behaviors not present in the original prompt.

### Silicon Oracle (RAE-Lite Architecture)
*Pure Math "Quasi-Reasoning" for Resource-Constrained Environments*

RAE-Lite is not just RAE without an LLM. It features a specialized kernel called **Silicon Oracle**, designed to emulate reasoning capabilities using Graph Topology instead of Neural Weights.

-   **Semantic Resonance Engine**: Implements "Resonance Waves" to spread query energy across the memory graph. It boosts memories that are topologically central to the query context, effectively "hallucinating" correct context without generating text.
-   **Performance**: Capable of **32.13 ops/sec** on CPU-only hardware with **100% precision** (Certified 2026-01-21).
-   **Use Case**: Ideal for embedded systems (Raspberry Pi), secure enclaves, and high-frequency trading bots where latency and determinism < 10ms are critical.

---

## 📐 The "Match Layers" Architecture (Refactored 2026-01-02)

RAE uses a unified mathematical engine to prevent Reasoning Drift. Following the **January 2026 refactoring**, the scoring logic is partitioned into three pure mathematical components:

1.  **Relevance (Math-1)**: Semantic similarity using vector embeddings.
2.  **Importance (Math-2)**: Intrinsic content value and structural graph centrality.
3.  **Dynamics (Math-3)**: Temporal decay and access frequency (Recency).

**Unified Scoring Formula:**
`S(m, q, t) = α·Relevance(m, q) + β·Importance(m) + γ·Dynamics(m, t)`

This multi-objective ranking ensures that retrieved context is not just "similar" but **logically and temporally coherent** with the current reasoning path.

---

## 🚀 Key Use Cases

- **Cross-Platform Knowledge Bridge**: Connect a Windows-based AI agent (like Cursor or Claude) to a high-performance RAE instance running on a Linux server.
- **Persistent Project Context**: Ensure your agent remembers architectural decisions across sessions and model switches.
- **Autonomous Quality Maintenance**: Periodic "Dreaming" cycles that compress and optimize memory for better retrieval.

## Quick Start

The easiest way to run RAE is with Docker Compose, now simplified with profiles.

First, clone the repository if you haven't already:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/dreamsoft-pro/RAE-agentic-memory.git
cd RAE-agentic-memory
```

### 1. Development Environment (Hot-Reload)
This is the **recommended setup for local development**. It enables hot-reloading for your code changes. The "Standard Profile" mentioned previously corresponds to this dev setup.
```bash
# Starts the full environment with hot-reload on port 8000
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d
```
*(Note: This command will be simplified to `docker compose --profile dev up -d` in a future step).*

### 2. Lite Environment (Minimal, Sandboxed)
A self-contained, minimal environment. Ideal for lightweight tasks or running in parallel with the main dev environment.
```bash
# Starts the lite environment on port 8008
docker compose --profile lite up -d
```

### 3. Standard Environment (Production-like)
This runs the base services without any development overrides (no hot-reload).
```bash
# Starts the base environment on port 8000
docker compose up -d
```

**For Developers (Hot-Reload & Autostart):**
You can set up RAE to start automatically on system boot with hot-reload enabled:
```bash
./scripts/setup_autostart.sh
```

For more detailed instructions, see the [Getting Started Guide](docs/LOCAL_SETUP.md).

## RAE in Action

Don't just store text. Store the *context* and *reasoning*.

```python
from rae_sdk import RAEClient

client = RAEClient()

# 1. Store memory with semantic importance
await client.store(
    content="User prefers local processing for PII data.",
    layer="semantic",  # Logic layer
    importance=0.9,
    tags=["privacy", "gdpr"]
)

# 2. Agent retrieves with reasoning trace
response = await client.agent.execute(
    "Should I upload the payroll file to the public cloud?",
    project="finance-bot"
)

# Result: "No. Strict Block. Rationale: User prefers local processing for PII data."
```

### 🔬 Scientific Use Case: Dynamic Hypothesis Refinement

This example demonstrates how RAE's 4-layer memory and 3-layer Math Control Plane enable autonomous scientific discovery.

**Scenario:** An agent is testing a new catalyst (Compound X) and encounters unexpected results.

1.  **Semantic Memory Retrieval (Math-1)**:
    *   *Agent Query:* "Expected reaction rate for Compound X?"
    *   *RAE:* Retrieves established theory: "Compound X should accelerate reaction at > 50°C." (Confidence: 0.95)

2.  **Episodic Memory Recording (Sensory -> Episodic)**:
    *   *Experiment:* Agent runs test at 60°C. Reaction fails.
    *   *RAE:* Records: `Episode(Action="Test 60C", Outcome="Failure", Surprise=High)`

3.  **Reflective Loop (Math-3 + Reflection)**:
    *   *Trigger:* `Surprise > Threshold`. The **Math-3** layer detects high Information Entropy (Theory vs. Observation divergence).
    *   *Reflection Engine:* Activates. It correlates this failure with a past vague episode "Compound X degrades in high humidity."
    *   *Consolidation:* RAE updates Semantic Memory: "Compound X is humidity-sensitive." (New Rule).

4.  **Policy Update (Math-2)**:
    *   *Adaptation:* The **Math-2 Controller** updates the retrieval policy for future chemistry queries to prioritize "Environmental Conditions" (Beta weight increased).

```python
# Detailed simulation available in: examples/scientific_discovery_simulation.py
```

## Filesystem Portability

RAE does not rely on hardcoded filesystem paths.
All paths are resolved relative to `PROJECT_ROOT` and can be overridden
using the `RAE_PROJECT_ROOT` environment variable.

### Directory Structure
- `data/` - Persistent storage (memory, logs)
- `config/` - Configuration files
- `core/paths.py` - Single source of truth for paths

To override the root directory (e.g., in Docker):
```bash
export RAE_PROJECT_ROOT=/app
```
