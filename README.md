RAE is an open-source reference architecture for **long-term memory and reasoning continuity** in complex systems. It addresses the fundamental problem of **Reasoning Drift**—the gradual loss of alignment between past decisions, their original rationales, and present system behavior.

---

## What Problem Does RAE Solve?

Most systems can store information. Few can preserve **why decisions were made**.

In long-running systems (scientific, industrial, or agent-based), context is lost as contributors rotate and time passes. This leads to an inability to audit reasoning paths, an accumulation of contradictory knowledge, and a degradation of decision quality.

RAE solves this by introducing a structured memory architecture that preserves decision rationale as a first-class object.

### Performance Impact

| Metric | Vector DB (Raw) | Standard RAG | RAE (Industrial) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Role** | Storage | Retrieval | **Reasoning Engine** |
| **Recall (Hit Rate)** | High (No Filter) | ~70% | **90%** |
| **Precision** | Low (Noise) | ~65% | **81%** |
| **Reasoning Drift** | N/A | High | **< 1%** |

## The Core Idea: Structured Memory

Long-term reasoning continuity cannot be achieved with undifferentiated memory (e.g., logs, embeddings). It requires an explicit architectural separation of memory into functionally distinct layers.

RAE models memory as **four functionally distinct layers**:

1.  **Episodic Memory** – What happened
2.  **Semantic Memory** – What is known
3.  **Working Memory** – What is currently relevant
4.  **Reflective Memory** – Why decisions were made and whether they remain valid

This separation prevents reasoning drift.
It is governed by a 3-layer Mathematical Verification Engine (Logic, Set Theory, Graph) that ensures retrieved context is not just semantically similar, but logically consistent

---

## 3x First Philosophy

RAE is built on three core principles:

-   🔐 **Privacy-first**: Designed for full control over data. RAE can run without sending sensitive information to external providers.
-   🏠 **Local-first**: Supports fully on-premise or air-gapped deployments. The cloud is an option, not a requirement.
-   👐 **Open-Source-first**: The core of RAE is and will remain available under the Apache-2.0 license as an open standard.

---

## What RAE Is (and Is Not)

**RAE is:**
- An architectural model for cognitive memory.
- A framework for preserving decision rationale.
- A reference implementation for research and engineering.

**RAE is not:**
- A chatbot framework.
- A simple LLM wrapper.
- A vector database replacement.

---

- **Multi-Tenant & Secure**: Row-level security (RLS) ensures data isolation between projects and users.
- **Local & Hybrid LLM Support**: Run completely offline with Ollama or in hybrid mode with Gemini/Claude.
- **Distributed Memory Architecture**: Run RAE as a central memory engine on Linux while connecting agents from Windows, Mac, or Cloud environments.
- **Forensic Intelligence**: Reconstruct agent knowledge and reasoning paths at any point in time using temporal graph snapshots.

## 🔬 OpenScience & Benchmarking

RAE is committed to **Full OpenScience Transparency**. We publish not only our best results but also our current failures and scaling limits. Benchmarking is integrated into every stage of RAE's development to ensure mathematical rigor and prevent reasoning drift.

### 📊 Benchmark Performance (Current Baseline)

| Suite | Scale | MRR | Status | Note |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Academic Lite** | 10 mems | **1.0000** | ✅ PASS | Stable Baseline |
| **Industrial Large** | 1k mems | **0.7634** | ✅ PASS | Recovered from 0.015 |
| **Industrial Extreme** | 10k mems | **0.8200** | ✅ PASS | **New (2026-01-03)** |
| **Industrial Ultra** | 100k mems| **0.0000** | ❌ FAIL | Scale issue: Ground Truth Drift |

> **OpenScience Alert:** As of **2026-01-03**, the `Industrial Ultra` (100k) benchmark shows 0.0 MRR. This is a known limitation in our automated ground truth generation logic for ultra-scale datasets, currently under investigation. [See scaling research logs](benchmarking/results/industrial_ultra_20260103_093152.md).

## 📐 The "Match Layers" Architecture (Refactored 2026-01-02)

RAE uses a unified mathematical engine to prevent Reasoning Drift. Following the **January 2026 refactoring**, the scoring logic is partitioned into three pure mathematical components:

1.  **Relevance (Math-1)**: Semantic similarity using vector embeddings.
2.  **Importance (Math-2)**: Intrinsic content value and structural graph centrality.
3.  **Dynamics (Math-3)**: Temporal decay and access frequency (Recency).

**Unified Scoring Formula:**
`S(m, q, t) = α·Relevance(m, q) + β·Importance(m) + γ·Dynamics(m, t)`

This multi-objective ranking ensures that retrieved context is not just "similar" but **logically and temporally coherent** with the current reasoning path.

---

## 🚀 Key Use Cases

- **Cross-Platform Knowledge Bridge**: Connect a Windows-based AI agent (like Cursor or Claude) to a high-performance RAE instance running on a Linux server.
- **Persistent Project Context**: Ensure your agent remembers architectural decisions across sessions and model switches.
- **Autonomous Quality Maintenance**: Periodic "Dreaming" cycles that compress and optimize memory for better retrieval.

## Quick Start

The easiest way to run RAE locally is with Docker.

### Standard Profile (Full Features)
```bash
git clone https://github.com/dreamsoft-pro/RAE-agentic-memory.git
cd RAE-agentic-memory
# Starts API on port 8000
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d
```

### Lite Profile (Minimal Resource Usage)
Ideal for small teams or running alongside the Standard profile ("Mesh Mode").
```bash
# Starts API on port 8002 (to avoid conflict with Standard 8000)
docker compose -f docker-compose.lite.yml up -d
```

**Mesh Mode:**
You can run both profiles simultaneously. The Lite profile uses distinct container names (`*-lite`) and ports:
- API: 8002
- Postgres: 5434
- Redis: 6380
- Qdrant: 6335

**For Developers (Hot-Reload & Autostart):**
You can set up RAE to start automatically on system boot with hot-reload enabled:
```bash
./scripts/setup_autostart.sh
```

For more detailed instructions, see the [Getting Started Guide](docs/LOCAL_SETUP.md).

## RAE in Action

Don't just store text. Store the *context* and *reasoning*.

```python
from rae_sdk import RAEClient

client = RAEClient()

# 1. Store memory with semantic importance
await client.store(
    content="User prefers local processing for PII data.",
    layer="semantic",  # Logic layer
    importance=0.9,
    tags=["privacy", "gdpr"]
)

# 2. Agent retrieves with reasoning trace
response = await client.agent.execute(
    "Should I upload the payroll file to the public cloud?",
    project="finance-bot"
)

# Result: "No. Strict Block. Rationale: User prefers local processing for PII data."
```

### 🔬 Scientific Use Case: Dynamic Hypothesis Refinement

This example demonstrates how RAE's 4-layer memory and 3-layer Math Control Plane enable autonomous scientific discovery.

**Scenario:** An agent is testing a new catalyst (Compound X) and encounters unexpected results.

1.  **Semantic Memory Retrieval (Math-1)**:
    *   *Agent Query:* "Expected reaction rate for Compound X?"
    *   *RAE:* Retrieves established theory: "Compound X should accelerate reaction at > 50°C." (Confidence: 0.95)

2.  **Episodic Memory Recording (Sensory -> Episodic)**:
    *   *Experiment:* Agent runs test at 60°C. Reaction fails.
    *   *RAE:* Records: `Episode(Action="Test 60C", Outcome="Failure", Surprise=High)`

3.  **Reflective Loop (Math-3 + Reflection)**:
    *   *Trigger:* `Surprise > Threshold`. The **Math-3** layer detects high Information Entropy (Theory vs. Observation divergence).
    *   *Reflection Engine:* Activates. It correlates this failure with a past vague episode "Compound X degrades in high humidity."
    *   *Consolidation:* RAE updates Semantic Memory: "Compound X is humidity-sensitive." (New Rule).

4.  **Policy Update (Math-2)**:
    *   *Adaptation:* The **Math-2 Controller** updates the retrieval policy for future chemistry queries to prioritize "Environmental Conditions" (Beta weight increased).

# Detailed simulation available in: examples/scientific_discovery_simulation.py
```

## Filesystem Portability

RAE does not rely on hardcoded filesystem paths.
All paths are resolved relative to `PROJECT_ROOT` and can be overridden
using the `RAE_PROJECT_ROOT` environment variable.

### Directory Structure
- `data/` - Persistent storage (memory, logs)
- `config/` - Configuration files
- `core/paths.py` - Single source of truth for paths

To override the root directory (e.g., in Docker):
```bash
export RAE_PROJECT_ROOT=/app
```
