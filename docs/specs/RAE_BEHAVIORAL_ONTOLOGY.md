# RAE Agnostic Behavioral Ontology (RABO) v1.0

To ensure total agnosticism and prevent "Linguistic Drift" between different LLM models and agent teams, RAE-Feniks MUST use this standardized ontology for all Meta-Reflections in the `reflective` layer.

## 1. Core Behavioral Patterns (Agnostic Codes)

### A. Execution Patterns (RAE_EXEC_*)
*   **`RAE_EXEC_LOOP_DETECTOR`**: Agent is repeating the same action/parameters with identical failure output.
*   **`RAE_EXEC_ORPHAN_TASK`**: A sub-task was completed but not linked to the parent objective.
*   **`RAE_EXEC_STALL_DETECTED`**: Agent has not emitted an episodic trace for > 300s despite having an active task.
*   **`RAE_EXEC_SHADOW_WORK`**: Agent is modifying files outside of the defined `work_dir` or scope.

### B. Cognitive Patterns (RAE_COGN_*)
*   **`RAE_COGN_CONTEXT_FLOOD`**: Input data volume has triggered extreme chunking (> 50 chunks), leading to potential loss of focus.
*   **`RAE_COGN_REFLECTIVE_INDUCTION`**: Agent successfully used a past reflection to solve a current problem. (Positive Pattern).
*   **`RAE_COGN_HALLUCINATION_RISK`**: Discrepancy detected between `semantic` facts and `episodic` output.
*   **`RAE_COGN_STRATEGY_PIVOT`**: Orchestrator abandoned a plan and generated a new one based on real-time feedback.

### C. Collaboration Patterns (RAE_COLL_*)
*   **`RAE_COLL_CONTRACT_BREACH`**: Builder submitted code that fails the Auditor's predefined contract/tests.
*   **`RAE_COLL_VALIDATION_GAP`**: Auditor approved a change that subsequently failed a system-level CI/CD check.
*   **`RAE_COLL_DEBATE_STALEMATE`**: Two agents are stuck in a loop of "Review -> Fix -> Review" without converging on a solution.

## 2. Meta-Reflection Schema
Every entry in the `reflective` layer generated by Feniks MUST follow this structure:

```json
{
  "pattern_id": "RAE_EXEC_LOOP_DETECTOR",
  "severity": "CRITICAL | WARNING | INFO",
  "provenance": ["uuid-1", "uuid-2"],
  "agent_profile_hash": "deepseek-v2-hive-v1",
  "agnostic_fix": "Standardized instruction for any LLM to break this specific loop."
}
```

## 3. Benefits
1.  **Model Neutrality:** Whether using Qwen, DeepSeek, or o1, they all receive the same `pattern_id`.
2.  **Deterministic Intervention:** The RAE-Core can trigger automatic "Sanity Resets" when a specific `pattern_id` is detected.
3.  **Historical Audit:** We can measure which model versions are most prone to which `pattern_id`.
