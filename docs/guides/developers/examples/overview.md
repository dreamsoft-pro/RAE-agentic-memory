# Examples & Integrations Overview

This document provides a brief overview of the different examples and integrations available in the RAE repository.

## Core Example

-   **[E2E Basic Usage](./e2e_basic_usage/)**: **Start here**. This is the canonical example that demonstrates the basic end-to-end workflow of storing and querying memories using the Python SDK. It's the best way to understand the core functionality of RAE.

## Standalone Agent Examples

-   **[Simple Refactor Agent](./simple-refactor-agent/)**: A simple agent that uses RAE to remember information about a codebase and perform a refactoring task.

## Integrations

-   **[LangChain](./integrations/langchain/)**: Shows how to use RAE as a memory backend for agents built with the LangChain framework.
-   **[LlamaIndex](./integrations/llama_index/)**: Demonstrates how to integrate RAE with LlamaIndex.
-   **[MCP Server](./integrations/mcp-server/)**: An example of how to use RAE with the Multi-purpose Collaborative Protocol (MCP) server for tool and IDE integration.
-   **[Agent Pipeline](./agent-pipeline/rae_pipeline/)**: An example of how to leverage the Gemini context cache with RAE.
