# For Healthcare

This guide is for organizations in the healthcare sector looking to use AI while adhering to strict data privacy and security regulations.

## What You Can Do

-   **Process sensitive data securely**: RAE's local-first and privacy-first design allows you to build AI systems that can handle sensitive patient data on-premise.
-   **Maintain audit trails**: Ensure compliance with regulations like HIPAA by maintaining a complete, auditable record of all data access and agent decisions.
-   **Develop clinical support tools**: Build AI assistants that can learn and remember context within a secure, controlled environment.

## Getting Started

1.  **Understand the security model**: RAE is designed with multi-tenancy, RBAC, and data isolation at its core. (TODO: Add link to security docs).
2.  **Plan an on-premise deployment**: RAE can be deployed in a fully air-gapped environment to ensure data never leaves your control.
3.  **Contact us for a consultation**: We can help you understand how RAE can be adapted to meet your specific compliance needs.
