# For Industry

This guide is for industrial users who want to leverage RAE to build robust, reliable, and auditable AI systems.

## What You Can Do

-   **Build enterprise-grade agents**: Create agents with persistent memory for use cases like advanced customer support, internal knowledge management, and process automation.
-   **Ensure data sovereignty**: Use RAE's local-first capabilities to deploy on-premise or in a private cloud, keeping your data secure.
-   **Audit and trace decisions**: Leverage RAE's structured memory and telemetry to maintain a full audit trail of your agents' reasoning processes.

## Getting Started

1.  **Review the security and compliance features**: Understand how RAE helps you meet enterprise requirements. (TODO: Add link to security docs).
2.  **Plan your deployment**: See the deployment guides for Docker and Kubernetes. (TODO: Add link to deployment docs).
3.  **Start a pilot project**: We are looking for partners to pilot RAE in real-world industrial environments. Contact us for more information.
