# For Developers: Quick Start & API Integration

This guide is for developers who want to integrate their applications with the RAE Memory Engine.

## What You Can Do

-   **Give your application persistent memory**: Store user preferences, session history, or any other data that needs to survive beyond a single session.
-   **Build context-aware applications**: Query the memory to retrieve relevant information and provide a more personalized user experience.
-   **Integrate with AI agents**: Use RAE as the long-term memory backend for your AI agents, allowing them to learn and evolve.

## Getting Started

1.  **Run RAE locally**: Follow the [Quick Start guide in the main README.md](../../README.md#quick-start) to get a local instance of RAE running.
2.  **Explore the API**: The RAE API is documented using OpenAPI. Once RAE is running, you can access the interactive documentation at [http://localhost:8000/docs](http://localhost:8000/docs).
3.  **Use the Python SDK**: The easiest way to interact with RAE is through the Python SDK. (TODO: Add link to SDK documentation).

## How to Collaborate
