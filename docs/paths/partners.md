# For Philanthropists & VCs: Research Partnerships

This guide is for venture capitalists, foundations, and philanthropists interested in supporting the development of open, transparent, and beneficial AI.

## Our Vision

We believe that foundational AI technologies, especially those related to memory and reasoning, should be open, auditable, and developed in the public interest. RAE is our contribution to this vision—an open-source standard for agent memory.

## How You Can Help

We are seeking partners, not just funding. You can help by:

-   **Supporting research**: Fund specific research initiatives that use RAE as a platform for studying agent memory and cognitive architectures.
-   **Facilitating pilot programs**: Help connect us with organizations that can pilot RAE in real-world scenarios, providing invaluable data and feedback.
-   **Providing infrastructure**: Support the project with computing resources for benchmarking, testing, and large-scale experiments.
-   **Grant funding**: Provide grants to support the continued development of the open-source core engine and its ecosystem.

Our model is to keep the core RAE engine fully open-source while potentially building commercial services around it to ensure long-term sustainability. We are looking for partners who share this "open core" vision.
