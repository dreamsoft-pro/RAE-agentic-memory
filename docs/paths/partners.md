# RAE for Partners & System Integrators

This document is for our partners, including system integrators, consultants, and managed service providers (MSPs), who are interested in leveraging the RAE (Reasoning and Action Engine) to build next-generation AI solutions for their clients.

## Why Partner with RAE?

The market for AI and automation is exploding. Your clients are no longer asking *if* they should adopt AI, but *how*. They need solutions that are robust, scalable, and can be securely integrated into their existing infrastructure.

RAE provides the core "long-term memory" component that is missing from most off-the-shelf AI solutions. By partnering with us, you can:

-   **Deliver More Value:** Move beyond simple chatbot or workflow automation projects. Build deeply integrated solutions that learn, adapt, and possess a persistent, context-aware memory of the client's business.
-   **Differentiate Your Offering:** Offer a unique capability that sets you apart from competitors. While others are offering stateless AI, you can deliver stateful, learning systems powered by RAE.
-   **Build on a Secure, Enterprise-Ready Platform:** RAE is designed for on-premise deployment, allowing you to meet the stringent security and compliance requirements of your enterprise clients in sectors like finance, healthcare, and government.
-   **Accelerate Delivery:** Use RAE as a ready-made, battle-tested component instead of building a complex memory and retrieval system from scratch for every client project.

## Partnership Opportunities

We offer a range of partnership models to suit your business needs. We are actively looking for partners to help us document and standardize solutions in key verticals.

**1. System Integrators & Consultants:**
-   **Role:** Design and implement bespoke solutions for enterprise clients using RAE as a core component.
-   **We Provide:** Technical training, dedicated support, co-marketing opportunities, and favorable licensing for development and PoC environments.
-   **Opportunity:** Become a certified RAE implementation partner in your region or vertical.

**2. Managed Service Providers (MSPs):**
-   **Role:** Host and manage RAE instances on behalf of your clients, offering "Memory-as-a-Service" as part of your portfolio.
-   **We Provide:** Deployment guides for scalable, multi-tenant architectures, and operational training for your support staff.
-   **Opportunity:** Add a high-value, recurring revenue service to your MSP offering.

**3. Technology Partners:**
-   **Role:** Integrate your own software products (e.g., platforms, security tools, data sources) with RAE to create a more powerful combined offering.
-   **We Provide:** Deep technical access, co-engineering support, and joint marketing initiatives.
-   **Opportunity:** Enhance your product's capabilities and open up new markets by leveraging RAE's long-term memory features.

**We invite you to become a pilot partner to help us define and document best practices for deploying RAE in your target industry.**
