# For Scientists & Researchers

This guide is for scientists and researchers who want to use RAE as a tool for studying cognitive architectures, agent memory, and long-term reasoning.

## What You Can Do

-   **Study a working model of cognitive memory**: RAE's 4-layer architecture provides a concrete reference implementation for research.
-   **Use the benchmarking suite**: RAE includes a comprehensive suite for running repeatable experiments and measuring memory performance (MRR, Hit Rate, etc.).
-   **Analyze system telemetry**: The mathematical layers provide deep insights into memory structure, dynamics, and decision policies.

## Getting Started

1.  **Explore the architecture**: Start with the core concepts outlined in the main [README.md](../../README.md).
2.  **Dive into the mathematical formalization**: (TODO: Add link to math docs).
3.  **Run the benchmarks**: See the [Benchmarking documentation](../../benchmarking/README.md) to run your first experiment.
