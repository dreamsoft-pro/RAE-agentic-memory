# For Public Administration

This guide is for public sector organizations that require transparency, auditability, and accountability in their AI systems.

## What You Can Do

-   **Build transparent AI services**: Use RAE to create systems where the reasoning process can be reviewed and understood.
-   **Ensure data sovereignty**: Deploy RAE on government infrastructure to maintain full control over citizen data.
-   **Enforce policies**: Use RAE's policy layer to implement and enforce rules and regulations automatically.

## Getting Started

1.  **Review the audit and traceability features**: RAE's architecture is designed to provide a clear "paper trail" for every decision.
2.  **Consider a local deployment**: RAE's local-first approach is ideal for public sector use cases.
3.  **Engage with us**: We are keen to partner with public sector bodies to pilot transparent and accountable AI.
