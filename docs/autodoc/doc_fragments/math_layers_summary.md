# 3-Tier Mathematical Foundation

RAE's mathematical layer provides **decision intelligence above memory**:

```
Math-3: Policy Optimization (What to do?)
  ↓
Math-2: Dynamics Tracking (How does it change?)
  ↓
Math-1: Structure Analysis (How does it look?)
```

These layers continuously monitor and optimize the 4-layer memory system, ensuring stability, adaptability, and cost efficiency.
